Here are the options:

File optoins:

-f <name.CSV> input file (.csv file required)

The weather options :

-w: wind wind ((w)ind )produces as output the average orientation and average speed of the winds for each station.
	When we talk about average, it will be a matter of summing for each component of the vector, and averaging once all the vectors have been processed.
	We will therefore have an average on the X axis and an average on the Y axis: the two results provide the average modulus and orientation required. 
	The data will be sorted by ascending station identifier.

-h : altitude ((h)eight).output the altitude for each station. Altitudes will be sorted in descending order.

-m : humidity ((m)oisture ). Outputs the maximum humidity for each station. 
	The humidity values will be sorted in descending order

-d<min> <max>: (d)ates the output data are in the date range [<min>..<max>]inclusive.
	The format of the dates is a string of type YYYY-MM-DD(year-month-day).

-t<mode>
-p<mode>

	value of<mode>:
	1: outputs the minimum, maximum and average temperatures (or pressures)per station in ascending order of station number.
	2: outputs the average temperatures (or pressures) by date/time, sorted in chronological order.
		The average is done on all the stations.
	3 : outputs the temperatures (or pressures) by date/time per station. They will be sorted first by chronological order,
		then in ascending order of the station ID.

Geographical limitation options :

-F : (F)rance: France + Corsica.
-G : (G)uyane fran√ßaise.
-S : (S)aint-Pierre and Miquelon: island located east of Canada.
-A: (A)ntilles.
-O: (O)Indian Ocean.
-Q : antarcti(Q)ue.

The sorting options :

--tab: sorting performed using a linear structure (either an array or a linked list).
--abr: sorting is done using an ABR structure.
--avl: sorting is done with a structure of type AVL.
